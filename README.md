# 1Password Chrome Extension that works with Chrome Manifest V3

<b style="color:red">UPDATE:</b> stopped working with Chrome 140, for that version, I made it work using info from [this thread](https://superuser.com/questions/1917854/is-there-any-way-to-still-use-manifest-v2-extensions-in-google-chrome-139)

Since Google Chrome has recently stopped running all v2 and earlier extensions, our standalone 1Password extension has become non-operational.

I have now converted its standalone extension to v3 for you to use. It works like a charm!


## Usage:

Just clone the code to your local drive and load it as an unpacked extension from the Chrome Extension Manager (`chrome://extensions`). 

Note that you must activate Developer Mode to load unpacked extensions.
